JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). It is a java class that should follow following conventions: Must implement Serializable. It should have a public no-arg constructor. All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods.

example
//Employee.java  
  
package mypack;  
public class Employee implements java.io.Serializable{  
private int id;  
private String name;  
public Employee(){}  
public void setId(int id){this.id=id;}  
public int getId(){return id;}  
public void setName(String name){this.name=name;}  
public String getName(){return name;}  
}
