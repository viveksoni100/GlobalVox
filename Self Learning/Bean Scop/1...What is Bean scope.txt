In Spring, bean scope is used to decide which type of bean instance should be returned from Spring container back to the caller.

5 types of bean scopes are supported :

1. singleton(default*)

Scopes a single bean definition to a single object instance per Spring IoC container.

2. prototype

Scopes a single bean definition to any number of object instances.

3. request

Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a single HTTP request; that is each and every HTTP request will have its own instance of a bean created off the back of a single bean definition. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

4. session

Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a HTTP Session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

5. global session

Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a global HTTP Session. Typically only valid when used in a portlet context. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
