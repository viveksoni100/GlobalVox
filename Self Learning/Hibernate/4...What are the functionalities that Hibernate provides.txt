Functionalities

Hibernate framework support Auto DDL operations. In JDBC manually we have to create table and declare the data-type for each and every column. But Hibernate can do DDL operations for you internally like creation of table,drop a table,alter a table etc.
Hibernate supports Auto Primary key generation. It means in JDBC we have to manually set a primary key for a table. But Hibernate can this task for you.

Hibernate framework is independent of Database because it supports HQL (Hibernate Query Language) which is not specific to any database, whereas JDBC is database dependent.

In Hibernate, Exception Handling is not mandatory, whereas In JDBC exception handling is mandatory.

Hibernate supports Cache Memory whereas JDBC does not support cache memory.

Hibernate is a ORM tool means it support Object relational mapping. Whereas JDBC is not object oriented moreover we are dealing with values means primitive data. In hibernate each record is represented as a Object but in JDBC each record is nothing but a data which is nothing but primitive values.
