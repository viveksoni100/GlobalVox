Spring allows lightweight and minimally invasive development with POJOs

POJO?
an object of a simple Java class that is not bound by framework specific restrictions
eg. doesn not extend or implement classes and interfaces required by EJB framework
but POJO is not bound by such restrictions

NOTE: POJO works equally well in spring as well as non-spring applications

Spring allows light weight servlet containers(Tomcat) instead of heavy application servers(JBoss)
Therefore, Spring applications can be developed and deployed even on computers with limited CPU resources and memory

Spring allows to use AOP / Aspect Oriented Programming which complements OOP by providing another way of thinking about program structure.
OOP : key unit of modularity is the CLASS
AOP : key unit of modularity is the ASPECT

Spring allows Loose coupling through Dependency Injection and interface orientation
